#1) Reverse a String "Pytjom Skills"

l = ['P','Y','T','H','O','N','_','S','K','I','L','L','S']

s = ''
for x in reversed(l):
    s += x
print(s)




#2) Assign String to x variable in DD-MM-YYYY format extract and print Year from String
x = '12-03-2003'

# Print Year from the string
print(x[6:])




# 3)In a small company, the average salary of three employees is Rs1000 per week. If one employee earns Rs1100 and other earns Rs500, how much will the third employee earn?
 Solve by using java programm

average = 1000
e1 = 1100
e2 = 500

e3 = (average - (e1 + e2)/3)*3   #Calculating salary of 3rd employee


print("Salary of Third employee is: ", e3



#4) Write Program - convert a percentage to a fraction 

# (To convert a percentage into fraction let say 30% to a fraction)

per = 30

f = per / 100

print ("Fraction of 30% is:" f)




#5) Write Program - A train 340 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr.
# What time will it take to cross a 160 m long tunnel?

trainlen = 340
tunnellen = 160

total = trainlen + tunnellen
speed = 45
mps = 5/18

# Calculating time to cross the tunnel
time = total / (45 * mps)

print ("Total time taken by train to cross the tunnel is: ",time)
